# CNPEN

During my work at the CNPEN - the French "National Pilot Committee for Digital Ethics" - I was asked to look into facial recognition technologies and study them from an ethical standpoint.

I thus developped a simple program to train and test a facial recognition algorithm, then hightlight the ethical issues that arise.

## 1. Train a model

Clone the repository on your own laptop or export it on a remote server (Google Colab, Kaggle Kernel etc).

Launch the training via the notebook xxx. You will get a file of your model parameters.

## 2. Test our model

Run the notebook xxx and observe the results. You can make your own tests depending on what issue you want to study.

## 3. Improve your model
